                            and/or app notifications), as well as an invitation email(s) or app notification(s) for you to
                            complete our guest review form which we will send to you after you finish an activity. Leaving a
                            review is optional. For clarity, the confirmation and guest review emails are transactional and
                            are not part of the newsletters or marketing mails, from which you can unsubscribe. The
                            completed guest review may be uploaded onto the relevant activity page on the GODEVI platform
                            within 72 hours of the submission for the sole purpose of informing (future) customers of your
                            opinion of the service (level) and quality of the Activity. Upon submitting a review, your
                            account will be awarded GODEVI credits, which may be used towards your next booking subject to
                            terms and conditions. Each account may only submit one review per activity booked once or
                            multiple times within the same calendar month. Fraud and abuse will result in the forfeiture of
                            GODEVI credits. GODEVI further reserves the right to deduct any credits directly from your
                            GODEVI account without prior notice.

                        </p>
                        <p> 10.2.1 Through this Website, you may purchase vouchers from GODEVI for the Services (“Vouchers”)
                            offered by the Operators in the various destinations. Subject to the policy of the relevant
                            Operator, you will receive an email confirmation of your purchase that will contain a Voucher
                            confirmation number (“Confirmation Number”) and a printable version of your Voucher.
                        </p>
                        <p> 10.2.2 In order to use your Voucher, you must appear in person at the meeting point designated
                            by the relevant Operator on time, and present such documents and/or information as may be
                            required by the Operator, that may include your Confirmation Number and/or your printed Voucher.
                            If you fail to appear on time or to provide the required documents or information, no refunds
                            will be granted.
                        </p>
                        <p> 10.2.3 An Operator may also require you to provide an identification document bearing your photo
                            in order to use your Voucher. Neither GODEVI nor the Operator is responsible for lost, destroyed
                            or stolen Vouchers or Confirmation Numbers. Vouchers will be void if the relevant Services to be
                            provided are prohibited by law. If you attempt to use a Voucher in an unlawful manner (e.g., you
                            attempt to use a Voucher for wine tasting when you are under the legal age to do so), the
                            respective Operator may refuse to accept your Voucher, and no refunds will be granted.

                        <p> 10.3.1 The Terms of Use for each Voucher may vary amongst Operators and any restrictions that
                            apply to the use of such Voucher, including but not limited to a minimum age requirement, will
                            be conveyed to you at the time of purchase on the Website.
                        </p>
                        <p> 10.3.2 Vouchers are admission tickets to one-time events ('Events'): the date(s) on which a
                            Voucher can be used will be stated on the Voucher. If you do not use your Vouchers on or by the
                            date(s) noted on such Vouchers, except as expressly set forth therein, no refunds will be
                            granted.

                        </p>
                        <p>10.4.2 The Operator, not GODEVI, is the offeror of the Services for the Events, to which the
                            Vouchers correspond to, and is solely responsible for accepting or rejecting any Voucher you
                            purchase, as related to all such Services.
                        </p>
                        <p>10.4.3 Please directly consult with the Operator if you have any enquiries or complaints in
                            respect of the Service you received in connection with your Voucher. Except as expressly set

                            will notify you as soon as reasonably practicable, and will process a full refund to the credit
                            card you used to purchase such Voucher.

                        <p>10.5.1 If you attempt to use a Voucher in accordance with this Terms of Use and the additional
                            terms and conditions applicable to such Voucher and you are unable to do so (due to the fault of
                            the Operator or otherwise), please contact GODEVI at hello@godevi.id and GODEVI will try to
                            liaise with the Operator for an appropriate remedy.

                        <p>11.1.1 GODEVI Credits are points that are awarded to you and will be accumulated in your GODEVI

                            purchased from GODEVI’s platforms, based on the award program at the time of purchase. Except as
                            otherwise stated, every ten (10) GODEVI Credits may be used to offset IDR 2000.00 of the total
                            check out price. Conversion into any other currencies will be calculated based on the exchange
                            rate GODEVI uses on the date of your purchase offset.

                        <p>11.1.2 GODEVI Credits may be earned through the following means and the amount of GODEVI Credit
                            received may vary with each purchase and is at the sole discretion of GODEVI: (a) rebates from
                            previous purchases (b) earning through any means authorized by GODEVI at its sole discretion (c)

                        <p>11.1.3 You will only receive GODEVI Credits for the first ten activities you have reviewed in any

                            will only receive GODEVI Credits for the first review you have submitted for that activity.

                            of the next calendar year. Therefore, if you are awarded a GODEVI Credit on 1 October 2019, that

                            the credits accumulated to date as of 25 September 2019, regardless of when you obtained the

                        </p>
                        <p>12.1.1 On certain GODEVI Sites, GODEVI may offer members the chance to earn GODEVI Coupons, when
                            they invite friends to become members of a GODEVI Site and those friends make a confirmed
                            booking through an authorized GODEVI invitation channel (“GODEVI Authorized Channel”) (e.g. an
                            invitation sent through GODEVI’s website, Facebook or another social media channel as supported
                            by GODEVI).

                        <p>12.2 Term
                        </p>
                        <p>12.2.1 You may only earn GODEVI Coupons via Godevi’s authorized member invite mechanisms.
                            Referrals outside of GODEVI Authorized Channel will not result in any GODEVI Coupons. You
                            understand that GODEVI Coupons are not transferable, may not be auctioned, bartered or sold, and
                            may not be pooled with other members.
                        </p>
                        <p>12.2.2 You will only receive GODEVI Coupons for the first confirmed booking made by a friend who
                            makes his or her first booking on the GODEVI Sites and subsequently completes his or her first
                            booking as a result of an invite from you via a GODEVI Authorized Channel. If your friend does
                            not follow the directions in the invite email or other valid invite mechanism to accept the
                            invitation, you may not receive GODEVI Coupons, and GODEVI will have no liability to you for
                            your friend’s failure to follow directions.
                        </p>

                            that sending invites to alternate email addresses or accounts or otherwise attempting to
                            circumvent the GODEVI Referral Program system may, without limiting any of Godevi’s other rights
                            or remedies, result in forfeiture of your membership and all GODEVI Coupons in your GODEVI
                            Account.

                        <p>12.2.5 GODEVI reserves the right to void referrals and GODEVI Coupons earned if it is suspected
                            that the referrals or GODEVI Coupons were earned in a fraudulent manner, in a manner that
                            violates this Terms of Use or in a manner otherwise not intended by GODEVI
                        </p>
                        <p>12.2.6 GODEVI Coupons will be emailed to your designated email address within 24 hours of one of
                            your qualifying invitees completing his or her confirmed booking on GODEVI’s website

                        <p>12.2.8 GODEVI Referral Program is void where prohibited by law. GODEVI reserves the right to
                            modify or terminate the GODEVI Referral Program at any time. Should there be any tax liability
                            for the accumulation and/or use of GODEVI Coupons, such taxes are the sole responsibility of the
                            participant. You understand that your GODEVI Account may not accurately reflect the GODEVI
                            Coupons you have actually earned. GODEVI will have no liability for any errors displayed in your
                            GODEVI Account.
