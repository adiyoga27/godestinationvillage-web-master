                                        GODEVI is a tourism company under of PT Banua Wisata Lestari. GODEVI stands for Go
                                        Destination Village. The GODEVI logo is inspired by Bali Starling birds. Bali
                                        Starling is represented as one of the rare and unique natural potentials. The colors
                                        that appear in the GODEVI logo are cheerful colors that represent tourist activities
                                        full of joyful experiences. GODEVI believes that the village as a gathering place
                                        for all potentials, each has a different uniqueness and deserves to be introduced to
                                        the world community. Like this Bali Starling, GODEVI hopes to be able to become a
                                        distinctive brand without losing the identity of the island of Bali. In addition,
                                        the starling star is green, which means that GODEVI as a digital-based business is
                                        expected to be able to use its mind to see all the opportunities and phenomena that
                                        occur while being oriented to environmental sustainability and always prioritizing

                                        <p>We know that plans can change sometimes, and thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve made it possible to
                                            cancel your booking if you really need to. Before canceling an experience,
                                            however, we suggest that you contact your host. They are very accommodating and
                                            might be able to adjust to your schedule if itâ€™s simply a change of date or
                                            time.
                                            If you still need to cancel your booking, you can do so from your
                                            Dashboard. Go to Dashboard > Your Bookings to find all your upcoming
                                            experiences. Click through to the booking you want to cancel, and at the bottom,
                                            youâ€™ll find a reminder of the experienceâ€™s cancellation policy and a button to
